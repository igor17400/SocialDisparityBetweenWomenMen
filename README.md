# SocialDisparityBetweenWomenMen
The goal of this data analysis research is to better understand sexism problems in Brazil. It is well known that women face much more obstacles then men in several areas in our society. But seeing those differences with charts makes easier to convey how large this difference is.

Making a quick search on google, you can find several articles about the disparity of women and men salaries, work top positions, percentage of doctorates and much more. Talking specifically about Brazil, we as a country suffer with lack of open data and infrastructure to understand the problems of our society. As a consequence, finding data about the differences of women and men such as opportunities and investments is a challenge.
